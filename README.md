# react-vis [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uber/react-vis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uber/react-vis)

![Demo of XYPlot](docs/assets/react-vis.gif?raw=true)

See the live demo at http://uber.github.io/react-vis

## Overview

A collection of react components to render common data visualization charts, such as **line/area/bar charts**, **heat maps**, **scatteplots**, **pie and donut charts**, **tables** with fixed headers and **tree maps**.

Some notable features:

- Simplicity. `react-vis` doesn't require any deep knowledge of data visualization libraries to start building your first visualizations.
- Flexibility. `react-vis` provides a set of basic building blocks for different charts. For instance, separate X and Y axis components. This provides a high level of control of chart layout for applications that need it.
- Ease of use. The library provides a set of defaults which can be overriden by the custom user's settings.
- Integration with React. `react-vis` supports the React's lifecycle and doesn't create unnecessary nodes.

## Usage

Install react-vis via npm.

```shell
npm install react-vis --save
```

Include the CSS from `./node_modules/react-vis/main` in your HTML page or via SASS:
```sass
@import "./node_modules/react-vis/main";
```

Import the necessary components from the library&hellip;

```jsx
import {XYPlot, XAxis, YAxis, HorizontalGridLines, LineSeries} from 'react-vis';
```

&hellip; and add the following code to your `render` function:

```jsx
<XYPlot
  width={300}
  height={300}>
  <HorizontalGridLines />
  <LineSeries
    data={[
      {x: 1, y: 10},
      {x: 2, y: 5},
      {x: 3, y: 15}
    ]}/>
  <XAxis />
  <YAxis />
</XYPlot>
```

## More information

Take a look at the [folder with examples](src/example) or check out some docs:

- Common concepts:
  * [Scales and Data](docs/scales-and-data.md) about how the attributes can be adjusted.
  * [Animations](docs/animation.md) about how to tweak animations in the library.
- Components:
  * [XYPlot](docs/xy-plot.md) about orthogonal charts.
  * [RadialChart](docs/radial-chart.md) about radial charts.

## Development

To develop on this component, install the dependencies and then build and watch the static files:

```
npm install && npm run watch
```

Once complete, you can view the component's example in your browser (will open automatically). Any changes you make to the example code will run the compiler to build the files again.

To lint your code, run the tests, and create code coverage reports:
```
npm test
```

## Change log

### v0.9.0

This release addresses a couple of bugs and improves our dep tree. The only psuedo-breaking change is to the layout of radial plot. The way that it now works is that the pie is centered within the given width/height and then allowed to grow to an innerWidth/innerHeight that is computed from the margins and the width/height.

- Bug: Modify margin system for radial chart
- Improvement: Support for classname on legends
- Chore: Remove duplicated styles
- Bug: Add default props to classname for axis
- Chore: Update deps, fix lint errors

### v0.8.0
This release adds two new props (and set of illustrative examples) to Hint component: ```align``` and ```getAlignStyle```. ```align``` (replacing ```orientation``` prop) is an object with two props &mdash; ```horizontal``` and ```vertical``` &mdash; and set of values that support existing and new hint placement:
  a) around a data point in one of four quadrants (imagine the point bisected by two axes &mdash; vertical, horizontal &mdash; creating 4 quadrants around a data point).
  b) **New**: pin to an edge of chart/plot area and position along that edge using data point's other dimension value.

Developers wanting total control can use the ```getAlignStyle(align, x, y)``` function that returns an inline style object with one or more of the following props (```left, right, top, bottom```).

The ```orientation``` prop is supported for backwards compatibility but will be deprecated in future release.

See the following figure explaining the two props  (```horizontal, vertical```) for the ```align``` prop object.

### v0.7.0
This release adds a new series: rectSeries. Rect series operates similarly to barSeries: they consist of a series of rectangles of various size that be stacked, but with one key difference. Where the bar series operates on the assumption of an ordinal axis, rect series operates on an assumption of a continuous one. This allows users to specify the positions of the edges of their rectangles!

Rect series are great for histograms, as they allow you to exactly specify the bounds of buckets. They can be accessed via VerticalRectSeries and HorizontalRectSeries. Check out the examples for more details. This is non breaking change, and can be dropped in immediately.


### v0.6.8
- Feature: Export Abstract series and the rest of the functions in scale utils.
- Feature: Add specific class names to x and y axes

### v0.6.6

- Improvement: added line smoothing via d3-shape curve functions ([#185](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/pull/185)).
- Improvement: Expose GridLines, AxisLines, and ScaleUtils to export
- Improvement: Add className prop to all series
- Documentation: Expand tree map example
- Documentation: Add elevated area chart example

### 0.6.4

- Bugfix: Fixed the issue with numeric titles in legends ([#154](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/pull/154)).

### 0.6.3

- Bugfix: fix the broken event listeners for radial charts ([#150](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/issues/150));
- Bugfix: compatibility fix: do not treat `null` and `undefined` in scale props as existing values ([#149](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/issues/149)).

### 0.6.2

* Feature: added a new `tickLabelAngle` property that rotates the tick label ([see the documentation](docs/xy-plot.md#ticklabelangle-optional) for details).
* Improvement: added a little bit of examples for the axes.
* Bugfix: fixed misplaced axis title when orientation is set to `'top'` or `'right'` ([#146](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/issues/146)).

### 0.6.1

* Bugfix: axis is misplaced when `orientation` is set to `'right'`([#143](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/issues/143)).

### 0.6

#### TL;DR

New legends (sic!), new animations, faster rendering of components, no d3 in actual rendering process, new examples and more.

#### Breaking changes

* `animation` property works differently: duration is removed in favor of stiffness, damping and precision. Please refer to the documentation for the latest changes.
* `undefined` and `null` values of important scale-related attributes for domains and ranges are now treated as real values (and not ignored anymore).

#### Non-breaking changes

* Feature: added the first version of legends (discrete and continuous color legends, continuous size legend). Please refer to the [docs for legends](docs/legends.md) for more details.
* Improvement: got rid of assigning properties with d3 after rendering, currently all attributes and event listeners are attached using React (and it is faster).
* Improvement: eliminated the use of `d3-selection` and `d3-transition` modules and made the source code smaller.
* Improvement: added some structure into the examples and simplified their source code ([check them out](http://uber.github.com/react-vis)).
* Bugfix: fixed crashing on animation (#114).
* Improvement: `onNearestX` event now returns the index of the selected data point as an attribute (more details [here](docs/xy-plot.md#onnearestx-optional))
* Bugfix: added the donut chart to the list of examples ([#83](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/issues/83)).
* Bugfix: fixed failing bar charts when the number of segments was changed ([#55](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/issues/55)).

### 0.5

#### TL;DR

Upgraded to modular d3, compiled code became smaller, changed the API for axes and grids, fixed several bugs.

#### Breaking changes

* d3-axis is no longer used, the rendering of axes and grids is made by react (and works faster).
* The API of axes (`XAxis` and `YAxis`) was significantly changed:
  * [the API of axes](docs/xy-plot.md#axes) is now (almost) compatible to the API of 'd3-axis'.
  * `labelFormat` and `labelValues` attributes for the axes are **removed**: similar results can be done achieved when `tickFormat` and `tickValues` attributes are used (see the [the updated documentation for axes](docs/xy-plot.md#axes) for more details).
  * `tickFormat` function is now gets only **one (value) argument instead of two (value and index)**.
* The API of grids (`VerticalGridLines` and `HorizontalGridLines`) was significantly changed: it partially replicates the API of the axes.  Please refer to [the updated documentation ](docs/xy-plot.md#grids) for more detail. 

#### Non-breaking changes

* Bugfix: `margin` for the radial and ortogonal chart is now able to receive partial objects (e. g.`<XYPlot margin={{left: 20}}>` instead of margins for each side) and numbers (e.g. `<XYPlot margin={20}>`)
* Bugfix: `makeVisFlexible` doesn't fail anymore (see [#118](https://github.com/uber-common/react-vis/issues/118)).
* Minor bugfixes and improvements.
