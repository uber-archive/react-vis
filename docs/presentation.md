# React-vis

__React-vis__ is a React visualization library. It's been designed with the following principles in mind:

## React-friendly:
React-vis components are designed to work just like other React components. They have properties, children and callbacks. They can be composed. If you can work with React components, you can work with React-Vis.

## High-level and customizable:
You can create complex charts with a minimum amount of code and sensible defaults, however, you can also customize every aspect of your chart.

## Expressive:
React-vis handles a great number of charts, from area charts to treemaps;

## Industry-strong:
React-vis was built to support the many internal tools at Uber.
