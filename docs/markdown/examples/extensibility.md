## Extensibility

react-vis is easily extensible! If we don't have what you want it's easy to make! For instance, the above chart
was made by simply extending abstract series and adding a little sugar. You can check out the code for your self [here](https://github.com/uber/react-vis/blob/master/examples/candlestick/candlestick.js)
