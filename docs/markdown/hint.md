## Hint

`Hint` is a simple component that shows tooltips inside the chart. Hint places itself to the place which is set by your data.
In case if custom representation of is needed, the component is also able to wrap custom JSX. Here is a short example:

```jsx
<Hint value={myValue}>
  <div style={{background: 'black'}}>
    <h3>Value of hint</h3>
    <p>{myValue.x}</p>
  </div>
</Hint>
```

### Style (optional)
Type: `Object`
You can pass a style object to your Hint component to apply your own styles. See [style](style.md)
```jsx
<Hint value={value} style={{fontSize: 14}}/>
```

Style is a composite component, and individual parts of it can receive different parts.
The different parts are: content, row, title, value. To style a specific part, you can pass an object to the property with that name.
```jsx
<Hint value={value} style={{
  fontSize: 14,
  text: {
    display: 'none'
  },
  value {
    color: 'red'
  }
}}/>
```
