## react-vis

react-vis is a charting library for React. 

It is: 

* __Expressive__: react-vis supports a large number of types of charts, from area charts to treemaps, as well as many charting elements like axes or tooltips. 
* __High-level__: react-vis is optimized for making charts with the least amount of code. It lets user access high-level components rather than force them to control every pixel,
* __Deeply customizable__: react-vis charts have sensible defaults, yet everything can be changed. 
* __Consistent with React__: a chart in react-vis is made of components which have properties and children, just like traditional react,
* __Industry-strong__: react-vis was created to support the many internal tools of Uber.
