# Deprecated

Unfortunately, `react-vis` currently has no active maintainers. As such, we have
decided to deprecate the library. This deprecation means that `react-vis` won't
receive any patches or new features. If you're interested to take on ownership,
please discuss on #1303. Anyone is welcome to fork this library.

We're working on a new charting library that we'll introduce in 2020. We will
keep you folks updated on this repo on the new library!
